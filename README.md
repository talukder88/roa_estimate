# Sum-of-squares Optimization-based Maximal Region-of-Attraction Inner-estimation for Trigonometric Dynamic Fields via Automated Lyapunov Function Search
This repo provides a MATLAB toolbox to inner-estimate maximal region-of-attraction (RoA) of continuous-time dynamical systems, where the dynamic field comprises trigonometric terms. It employs sum-of-squares optimization-based automated search of Lyapunov functions implemented using [SOSTOOLS](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/sostools/). This method was used in this work:
[Resilience Indices for Power/Cyberphysical Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9198917).

The code was tested in MATLAB R2021a on Windows. [SOSTOOLS](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/sostools/) is the only dependency to be installed first. Then simply clone this repo and add
