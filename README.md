# Sum-of-squares Optimization-based Maximal Region-of-Attraction Inner-estimation for Trigonometric Dynamic Fields via Automated Lyapunov Function Search
This repo provides a MATLAB toolbox to inner-estimate maximal region-of-attraction (RoA) of continuous-time dynamical systems fields, where the dynamic field comprises trigonometric terms. It employs sum-of-squares optimization-based search of Lyapunov functions implemented using SOSTOOLS. This method was used in this work:
