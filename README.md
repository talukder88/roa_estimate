# Sum-of-squares Optimization-based Inner-estimation of Maximal Region-of-Attraction for Trigonometric Dynamic Fields via Automated Lyapunov Function Search
This repo provides a MATLAB toolbox to inner-estimate maximal region-of-attractions (RoA) of continuous-time dynamical systems, where the dynamic field may include trigonometric terms. Open-source implementations for automated search of Lyapunov function are available for systems with polynomial dynamic fields; however, dynamic model of practical systems (e.g., in robotics, power systems, etc.) often comprise trigonometric terms. This toolbox can handle such systems (see our work [Resilience Indices for Power/Cyberphysical Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9198917) for application in classical power system models). 

It employs sum-of-squares optimization-based automated search of Lyapunov functions. This method was used in this work:
.

This toolbox was tested in MATLAB R2021a on Windows, but it should be backward compatible with prior MATLAB versions. [SOSTOOLS](https://www.cds.caltech.edu/sostools/) and one of its supported backend semidefinite program (SDP) solver are the only dependencies, which needs to be installed first (see [here](https://github.com/oxfordcontrol/SOSTOOLS) for their installations). Then simply clone this repo and add the cloned directory (including all subdirectories) into MATLAB search path. See the example to get started. SOSTOOLS supports various SDP solvers, but Mosek is recommended owing to its superior performance compared to the rest. Mosek is commercial SDP solver, but a free license may be available from Mosek free of cost for academic usage (see [here](https://www.mosek.com/products/academic-licenses/) for more information).
